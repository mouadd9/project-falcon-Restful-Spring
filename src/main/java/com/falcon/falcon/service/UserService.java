/**
 * This service handles user-related operations, including membership management.
 *
 * The joinRoom method is placed here because:
 * 1. The User entity is configured with cascade=CascadeType.ALL on its memberships collection,
 *    meaning it's responsible for persisting RoomMembership entities
 * 2. From a domain perspective, users initiate the action of joining rooms
 * 3. Transaction boundaries are cleaner when a single service manages the entire operation
 *
 * By following these principles, we maintain a clear separation of concerns where
 * UserService manages user-driven actions and the lifecycle of entities owned by User.
